# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 12, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Today I commit to the 100 Days of Code Challenge and sent out my tweet. I am working on a course through Udemy called The Complete Web Developer 2.0 and am current about 20% throug it, working on a project to Clone a website using HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** The course is a new approach for me, where before I was strictly working off of FreeCodeCamp and WW3School.com. Those are great resources but the course is helping me organize a little. Feeling optomistic about my momentum :)

### Day 2: April 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Cloning project complete and it looks great. Took the CSS Level 1 certification and passed. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling much more comfortable with CSS and HTML. It's nice to see how much I retained from my rounds of FreeCodeCamp. I am able to go through the tasks myself first for the most part, then back up and see what they did. I find a few differences in approach, and a few bugs, but overall I am getting it.

### Day 3: April 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today started the JavaScript section of my course. about 23% through overall course. Leaning  onclick and buttons. Pretty basic stuff but important to start. 

**Thoughts** JavaScript has been rough for me to this point. It's where I've gotten stuck before and lost momentum. I am determined to not do that again. So far I am grasping the concepts better, so good start. Capitization matters, which is tripping me up a bit. Got so used to HTML and CSS where that wasn't a big deal.

### Day 4: April 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Still more JavaScript.  Working through arrays and variables and how to apply them with If and else statements and loops. 

**Thoughts** I finally get to make things move!!!!! I love the design parts of CSS but the interaction and usability is exciting. It is very much it's own language though so working to get the syntax and structure down. 


### Day 5: April 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Taking a slight break from JavaScript to bounce back to FreeCodeCamp and the Responsive Web Design Projects- Landing Page. 

**Thoughts** I've started it before, but since I've gone further into CSS and HTML I am starting over so I can get a measure of my progress.
